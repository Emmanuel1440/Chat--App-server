 #  🔍 Reflection

✅ What I Built
I created a full-stack real-time chat application that allows authenticated users to send messages, edit/delete them, react with emojis, and share media files—all updated live using WebSocket.

📘 What I Learned
     Setting up and managing WebSocket connections in Node.js.

      a). Implementing JWT-based authentication with secure endpoints.

      b).How to integrate PostgreSQL for relational data modeling.

      c).Managing real-time reactions and state updates in React.

      d). Using Bootstrap for responsive UI design.

🔧 What I’d Improve
      >> Add typing indicators and read receipts.

      >>Better error handling for WebSocket and fetch requests.

      >>Improve the database schema for reaction aggregation.

      >>Add unit tests and integration tests for backend APIs.

      >>Deploy app using Docker and CI/CD pipelines.
